                                It’s late 2016. Many people say conversational UI is the future of web interface. IM
                                apps, chatbots, text-based UIs or emojis probably have never been more popular. Some
                                might say it’s just another design fad or that text-based interfaces aren’t anything
                                new, but frankly — let’s admit it — with the advent of iPhone Messages, Slack or
                                Facebook Messenger the way we exchange information changed irreversibly. Text messages
                                have became extremely natural way of communicating these days.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So naturally, when a chance arose for The Rectangles to work on a conversational website
                                for one of our clients, we didn’t hesitate a single second.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Project objectives</h2>

                                <li>
                                    Create a conversation script

                                    Convey the brand’s character (also by using company’s brand hero

                                I’ll show you how we did it step by step, but first…
                            </p>

                            <h2>A bit of theory</h2>
                            <p>
                                Let’s start with the basics. I think sometimes it’s important to make a step back for a
                                short while before diving into more complex matters. In this case it really helped us.
                                Believe it or not, but reading through all those fundamental definitions opened our eyes
                                on a few creative solutions and boosted the entire ideation process.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And I think you shouldn’t skip this part too.

                            <h2>The principles of communication</h2>
                            <p>
                                There are hundreds of definitions explaining communication. The one below is my hybrid
                                version of a few I found.
                            </p>

                            <div class="quote text-1 text-center text-color-third">
                                <div class="quote__text">
                                    Communication is a process of sharing meaningful messages
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>
                                The messages (communication in general) can be verbal or non-verbal.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The most common verbal communication tool is language,which is a set of symbols used to
                                exchange information in the form of words that can be transformed into meanings.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Examples: Hello; Thank you; You look great today
                                Non-verbal, by contrast, refers to any type of communication different from words. It
                                can be gestures, facial expressions, tone of voice, but also actions or symbols which
                                have a common social meaning.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Communication is a process where all the aspects affect one another. It means that
                                communication is holistic and that the entire process creates a system in which all the
                                elements (all the messages) work together for the common good.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                These messages are functional which means we use them to obtain desired effects, but
                                also adaptive — meaning that, depending on the situation, they can be modified and
                                adjusted in order to achieve better results.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Finally, the language we use to communicate is based on communication code, which is a
                                set of principles and meanings. They create the base for interpretation. This
                                communication codes are also called rules; there are two types of them:
                            </p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Constitutive rules: referring to the sense and the meaning of particular words, and how we should interpret them. Also, they tell us how to understand a message in a particular context.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Normative rules: helping to determine a proper reaction based on a given message interpretation. In other words, they tell us what we should and what we should not do (say) in a particular situation.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
